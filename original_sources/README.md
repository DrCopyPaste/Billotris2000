# This is legacy code from somewhere in 2006

I cannot be sure what version this is. I found 2 or 3 different builds which I will release later, I suppose this code belongs to the latest of those.
Since I am currently not able to get this to run (using the original SDL 1.2 libraries) I am now dumping this here so it stays archived :D

For this to work you will of course need the proper SDL.dll together with the exe-file, as well as the bmp-files included in this directory.
