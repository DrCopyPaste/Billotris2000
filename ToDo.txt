- there are at least 2 different versions that I only have the binaries from, release those as "pre-releases" or alongside next "real" release as additional zip-files
- setup project management and issues
- maybe change default background/ bricks and preview
- sort methods and classes into separate files
- now look on how to improve readability further and simplify code
- add captions for numbers ingame (which score is which where is level display?)
- add game mode selection screen and highscore table
- try using real fonts instead of bmp-fonts
- work out bugs (like rotation movement)
- sounds?
- controller/different keyboards?
- multiplayer? (same computer split screen / network)
- setup cross platform builds (azure integration?)
- built folder structure (images into subfolder...)
- installer (wix/multiplattform?)
- 64 bit?
