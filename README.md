A maybe futile attempt to salvage a thirteen year old throw away tetris clone.

I just recently (December 2019) rediscovered my old code for this cheap tetris clone from 2006.
The builds do still run, though I have not yet tried to get the IDE running for this.
The plan for this is the following:

- get the original code and game from 2006 (i saw 3 different versions, lets see how I would release those)
- setup to be able to build it with a current IDE
- change identifiers and indentation etc. to be consistent
- sort methods and classes into separate files
- now look on how to improve readability further and simplify code
- try upgrading to a current sdl version (2006 version uses  1.2)
- add game mode selection screen and highscore table
